# Specifications for the CLI Assessment

Specs:
- [x] Have a CLI for interfacing with the application == users can pick a format, select a deck, and return to previous menus before exiting
- [x] Pull data from an external source  == scrapted mtggoldfish.com for metagame data for both standard and modern formats, then passed that data through to my CLI
- [x] Implement both list and detail views == the list of all the decks in the current metagame populates once a format is picked. You can then select the number of that deck to display it's details separately.
